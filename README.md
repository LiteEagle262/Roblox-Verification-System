# Roblox-Verification-System
Very simple roblox verification system, to verify users by a phrase generated in connection to there account.

to use this just have a folder `db/` then you can just use the definitions to register users, I dont recomend this if your making a deployable website/bot because it has no advanced error handling, checking systems, and you also cant genorate a new phrase in connection to teh account, this is just a example of how you can easily emplament this into your website/program!
